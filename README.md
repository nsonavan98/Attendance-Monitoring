# Attendance Monitoring System
This project aims to build a POC on an automated Attendance Monitoring System.
The main src fold contains 3 files which comprise of our main application. The dataset folder is where the facial data of individuals will be stored. It involves:
1. Database Creation - This involves creating the facial datasets of the students.
2. Database training - This involves the training of the facial datasets of the students createdin the first step.
3. Attendance Monitoring System - This is the  part which involves the main attendance monitoring system.

## Features
This project has the following applications:
1. Recording attendance on a daily basis
2. Marking monthly defaulters (Students having a monthly attendanace less than 75%)
3. Marking semester defaulters (Students having a semester attendanace less than 75%)

## Dataset
The dataset is created on runtime application, by recording each individual's faces.

## Future-improvements
1. Improve code quality
2. Change the code inputs from hardcoded to real time inputs based
3. Change it to microservices based system

## Disclaimer
Please don't judge my coding skills bases on this project, it's just a POC and I was just staring my coding journey :). Additionally the purpose was just to plan out the main full-fledged application.
